## Description
The DiverReef database provides the first public dataset on the underwater behavior of recreational divers in shallow reef environments (< 25 m depth) globally and their interactions with the reef seascape and/or reef benthic sessile organisms. The dataset comprise 19 years of data (2004-2023) by observing the behavior of 2312 recreational divers in 9 countries at 19 diving destinations and 179 diving sites. The data were collected through on-site observation of divers' behavior during tourism activities and their physical interactions with the reef structure and/or benthic reef sessile organisms. Observers discretely followed divers and recorded their behavior and interactions with the reef over set time periods. Interactions were described as "contact" and "damage", the latter reffers to when physical damage to a benthic organism or the reef structure was observed. Besides behavior, observers also recorded data on the type of diving activity (scuba or snorkeling), profiles of the divers (gender and experience), use of cameras by the divers, visibility,  type of reef formation and marine protection status of the dive site.
